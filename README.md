# CarDashboard_OpenGL
In this project, we have used OpenGL to create an animated car dashboard with a 2D background. The dashboard includes a GPS module that displays the car's location and navigation information. The interface is designed to be interactive, allowing users to control the animation using keyboard events. Our goal was to create a visually appealing and functional dashboard that demonstrates the power of OpenGL for creating 2D graphics and animations. This project is an assignment that showcases our skills in OpenGL programming and our ability to bring to life complex designs and functionalities.
